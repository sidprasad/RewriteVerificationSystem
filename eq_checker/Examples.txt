prop_logic_rules.pl: This file includes some basic rules in
	propositional logic, with 'true' and 'false' as constants. '+' represents
	'OR', '*' represents 'AND'. '-' Represents negation in linear terms and
	'~' represents negation in trees. After consulting this file, along with 
	'rewrite_equality_checker3.pl', one can check equalities in the system
	as follows:
		i. equal(a + (b * true), a + (b), 0, C1, C2, Rw). (True)
		ii. equal((-(p * q))+ (p + q), true, 2, C1, C2, Rw). (True)
		iii.  equal(a + b + c + d + true, false , 2, C1, C2, X) (False)
